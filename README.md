## Hi My Name is Michel Cuero CEO of BRB-BeautyRightBack Inc👋

- 🔭 I'm currently focused on building a billion-dollar company dedicated to revolutionizing the beauty industry. We're developing an AI-powered subscription marketplace that's transforming beauty services and advertising.
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my studies as a full stack developer at Robertson College.

- As the CTO and technical founder of my company, I lead the development of cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions that drive our business forward 🚀. My role involves crafting complex algorithms that power our AI-driven platforms, ensuring they are not only efficient but also scalable to meet the growing demands of our users 🧠💻. I am deeply involved in designing technology that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, constantly exploring new methodologies and tools to stay ahead of the curve 🔧✨.

Beyond the technical aspects, I also focus on creating sophisticated business models that align with our strategic goals, ensuring that our technological innovations translate into real-world value 💡📈. My approach to problem-solving is highly structured; I utilize detailed flowcharts and process diagrams to map out solutions to major challenges, enabling my team to visualize and execute complex strategies with precision 🎯🗺️.

In addition to these responsibilities, I collaborate closely with other departments to integrate technology seamlessly into our overall business strategy, ensuring that our innovations not only meet technical standards but also drive our market success 🤝🏆. My passion for technology and my commitment to excellence fuel my drive to build a company that not only excels in the beauty industry but also sets new standards in how technology can revolutionize traditional business models 💪💼.

I'm a strong believer in God, and my favorite Bible verse is Joshua 1:9: "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."
